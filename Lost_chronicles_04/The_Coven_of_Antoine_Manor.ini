name.English=The Coven of Antoine Manor
synopsys.English=Your only hope of escaping the witch's lair is to identify your captor, among your fellow capives.
description.English=While searching for missing people in Arkham, you stumble upon a sinister, abandoned mansion, your Investigation of which has barely begun, when you are struck from behind, and wake up locked up in a basement. You've been captured by a witch with a sinister agenda, and if you're to escape, you'll have to band together with her other victims. Just be careful not to confuse a fellow captive, for the murderous witch herself.

The game changes each time, giving room for replay, and it only uses base game components, so it's great for playing it!
