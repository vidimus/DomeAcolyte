description.English=While pursuing the Cult of Cthulhu, you find yourself imprisoned in a realm quite unlike anything you've seen before. Your strange prison almost seems as though it was designed to be escaped, but it certainly won't be easy. A clock ticks down to a gruesome fate, you daren't imagine, and you can only pray you'll be able to focus on the puzzles, keeping you entombed.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n <b>This Scenario is an Escape room style scenario which requires the completion of custom puzzles to progress. \n \n It only uses the base game.</b>
