synopsys.English=The Cult of Cthulhu roam the streets and your choices will determine if you stop them or die trying.
description.English=A temple to Cthulhu has been discovered, in the frigid wastelands of Antarctica. After a research expedition to the temple is arranged and carried out by the Miskatonic University, the crew of the SS Fairmont make their way back to Arkham, with a cargo hold full of eerie, eldritch artefacts. \n \n They seem no worse for it, right up until the ship runs ashore, and a rescue team finds the crew have lost their minds, crying the praises of the sinister Ancient One. \n \n Something in Arkham wiped the minds of a ship full of people, and it seems to be drawing more Cultists by the hour. Arkham is soon overrun, and your choices will determine if you make it to the ship alive, and whether or not you're able to find and destroy the malevolent item causing this nightmare.
